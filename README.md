## Project Description

**Jumping Jumper** is an engaging JavaScript-based platformer game developed using HTML5 Canvas. Players control a character navigating through a series of platforms while avoiding various obstacles such as projectiles, lasers, and moving walls. The game introduces a strategic "Flow" mechanic that allows players to temporarily slow down time, providing an edge in dodging incoming threats. As players survive longer, the game's difficulty scales dynamically, offering an increasingly challenging and immersive experience.

## Features

- **Double Jump:** Perform up to two consecutive jumps to reach higher platforms.
- **Flow Mechanic:** Activate "Flow" mode by pressing the **"C"** key, consuming FLOW points to slow down projectiles and platforms for a limited duration.
- **Dynamic Difficulty:** The game progressively becomes more challenging with faster projectiles, more frequent obstacles, and increased wall speeds.
- **Visual Effects:** Screen inversion and expanding "FLOW" text effects enhance the visual experience during Flow mode.
- **Responsive Design:** The game adjusts to various screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.
- **Game Over & Retry:** Upon collision with obstacles, the game displays a Game Over screen with survival time and an option to retry.
